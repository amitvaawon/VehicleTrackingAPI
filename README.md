          For registering vehicle and record the position of vehicle we can use => https://localhost:44309/api/vehicle .
          Also searcing functionality available with same api.
          
          For adding new property into database need to change the code only. No need to update database.
          Because I am using NoSQL db. As per JSON format we can store data into db.
